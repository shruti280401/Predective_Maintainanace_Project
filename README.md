## Predective Maintainance of Gas Turbine Component Degradation in Naval Vessels
Predictive maintenance is a strategy used to anticipate when equipment or machinery is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed just in time to address issues before they lead to a breakdown. This approach relies on various data sources and techniques to monitor the condition and performance of equipment in real time or at regular intervals.

Here's how it generally works:

  1)Data Collection: Sensors and monitoring tools gather data on equipment conditions, such as temperature, vibration,           pressure, and other relevant parameters.

  2)Data Analysis: The collected data is analyzed using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical techniques to identify patterns or signs of potential failures.

  3)Prediction: Based on the analysis, predictions are made about the likelihood of equipment failure and the remaining useful life of components.

  4)Maintenance Planning: Maintenance activities are scheduled based on these predictions, allowing for repairs or replacements to be made before an actual failure occurs.
