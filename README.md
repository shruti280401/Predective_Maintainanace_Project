## Predective Maintainance of Gas Turbine Component Degradation in Naval Vessels
Predictive maintenance is a strategy used to anticipate when equipment or machinery is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed just in time to address issues before they lead to a breakdown. This approach relies on various data sources and techniques to monitor the condition and performance of equipment in real time or at regular intervals.

This application aims to predict the <b>failure of gas turbine components in naval vessels for predictive maintenance</b> using machine learning techniques. It employs a synthetic dataset and is built using a Random Forest model to assess the likelihood of component failure based on various input parameters. The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative data from surveys and the ###Random Forest model### to enhance prediction accuracy and maintenance strategies.
